				Please consider making a donation to the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Engineers 
				Without Borders. Though we receive modest funding for group activities and 
				outreach, we are still in need of your help in funding both of our projects, the potable water supply project for the village of Tingo Pucara, Ecuador and the sustainable energy supply project in the City of Rampur, India. <br /><br />
	
				Currently, the women and children of the Tingo Pucara spend upwards of three hours a 
				day traveling to a water source, collecting water, and carrying it back to the 
				village. Our goal is to sustainably, reliably, and safely pump water up a 1000 
				foot high hill in order to provide 70 liters a day to each of Tingo Pucara's 
				150 residents. Though we are handling the design and implementation, we cannot 
				fund the entire project.<br /><br />
				
				In Rampur, most schools provide education to children of the udnerprivileged section of society, but are under-funded. The government-provided electric power is intermittent and inadepquate to meet the basic demand for lights, fans, or computers. Dark classrooms and hot classrooms are day to day struggles that students and teachers must deal with. We are hoping to make the first trip to Rampur of spring break of this year, but need any help we can get to make that a reality. <br /><br />
				
				<!--A donation of $25 will provide a water purification pot for one family. A 
				donation of $50 will pay for 25 feet of flexible piping. These are just a 
				few examples.<br /><br />-->
