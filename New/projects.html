                    <p>This project works to provide consistent energy to
                    Niyadire, a Methodist Mission complex located three hours
                    northeast of Harare, the capital city. The community is
                    home to about 3,000 people and a hospital, orphanage, and a
                    teacher's college. Their electricity is currently provided
                    by the unreliable Zimbabwe Electrical Supply Author (ZESA).
                    Community members experience multiple unscheduled energy
                    blackouts each day and night, which presents a significant
                    roadblock to the effective operation of the schools, the
                    hospital, and homes.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to working with Niyadire through 2020.
                    Our first project is to build a street lighting system
                    independent of the government electricity grid. The lights
                    will allow community members to use the campus at night,
                    which is currently unsafe.</p>
                    <p>The team carried out alternatives analysis during the
                    Fall 2015 semester to identify the most cost-effective and
                    sustainable alternative energy source to power the street
                    lights, considering decentralized and centralized solar,
                    hydropower, biogas, and grid-charged batteries. Based on
                    their research, the team is pursuing decentralized solar
                    for their first project and are currently doing design
                    work. We plan to travel to Zimbabwe in August 2017 to
                    implement our design.</p>

                            national park and collected data on local recycling
                            habits, the team spent 2014-2015 researching

                            cutting, fusing, decontouring, and roof design.

                    <h4>Variable to Constant Width Ribbon</h4>
                    <p>This project aims to take a continuous ribbon of plastic
                    that is of a roughly consistent, but variable width and
                    design a system that will produce a ribbon of uniform width
                    for a variety of uses.</p>
                    <h4>Woven Mat</h4>
                    <p>This project aims to take a continuous ribbon of plastic
                    that is of uniform width and design a system to weave this
                    ribbon into a woven mat for a sheet-like product.</p>
                    <h4>Fencing</h4>
                    <p>This projects aims to take a continuous ribbon of
                    plastic that is of uniform width and design a system to
                    create fencing for a variety of applications such as
                    landscaping and construction.</p>
                    <h4>Washing and Drying Inorganic Waste</h4>
                    <p>This project aims to take the waste produced by all of
                    the repurposing processes and design a system that washes
                    and dries it, prepping it for use as packing material for
                    eco-bricks.</p>
                    <h3>Past Research Groups</h3>
                    <h4>Cutting</h4>
                    <p>The cutting section of the PET Thatch project aims to
                    create a method to cut off the tops and bottoms of the
                    bottles and then cutting the bottles into strips. The focus
                    is to make this process automated and efficient, while
                    keeping it safe. In the past semester, they have created a
                    prototyping model for a cutting chute, sketched out a plan
                    for strip cutting rollers, and are in the process of
                    testing cutting blades.</p>
                    <h4>Fusing</h4>
                    <p>As part of the PET Thatch project, the fusing section is
                    responsible for connecting the individual plastic strips
                    from the cutting section into longer plastic thatch for the
                    roof design section. The main concerns of the section are
                    to make the fusing process easy to learn, affordable, and
                    effective. Currently, the team is researching alternative
                    methods of fusing and have determined three effective
                    mechanical alternatives to ultrasonic fusing.</p>
                    <h4>Decontouring</h4>
                    <p>Decontouring is the process by which ridges and
                    deformations are removed from surfaces. The decontouring
                    team of the PET Thatch project is currently developing a
                    device to accomplish this task. The team has finalized a
                    design utilizing a heated roller system and plan on
                    constructing this system in the upcoming weeks.</p>
                    <h4>Roof Design</h4>
                    <p>This groups looks at the holistic system by creating
                    ideas in manufacturing and application while identifying
                    what end product will perform best through prototypes and
                    experimentation. In the past few months, the team has
                    created a test frame to build model roofs and prototyped
                    new methods of assembling plastic roof tiles.</p>

                    <h1>Tingo Pucara</h1>
                    <p>Since 2008, EWB-CMU, along with EWB members from the
                    University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Professional
                    chapters, have partnered with the community of Tingo
                    Pucará. This indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Andes
                    highlands wants to boost their quality of life through
                    better access to potable water and sanitation. In 2012, a
                    potable water pumping system was constructed, with
                    tapstands installed at each home. To further improve health
                    and sanitation, the community asked for help constructing
                    latrines (design is shown to left). EWB is finalizing a
                    design and materials list for a single pit ventilated
                    latrine. The latrines will be constructed primarily of
                    concrete and designed to last a minimum of 10 years.
                    Eventually, a latrine will be constructed at each home. The
                    team plans to travel to Ecuador this May. Concurrently, a
                    new tri-chapter effort, hosted by the Pittsburgh
                    Professionals, for a similar water pumping project has
                    begun for the nearby community of Curingue.</p>
